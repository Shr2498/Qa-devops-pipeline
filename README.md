# QA in Agile/DevOps Pipeline

This project demonstrates the implementation of QA practices in an Agile/DevOps environment with continuous testing, automated CI/CD pipeline integration, and early defect detection.

## QA Strategy

### Testing Pyramid
1. **Unit Tests** (70%) - Fast, isolated component testing
2. **Integration Tests** (20%) - API and service integration testing
3. **E2E Tests** (10%) - Critical user journey validation

### Continuous Testing Practices
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Automated test execution on every commit
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback
- Test result reporting and metrics
- Quality gates preventing bad code from advancing

### Early Defect Detection
- Static code analysis (SonarQube)
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Code coverage enforcement
- Performance regression testing

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Start application: `npm start`
4. Run quality checks: `npm run quality-check`

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Code Commit** → Triggers pipeline
2. **Static Analysis** → Code quality checks
3. **Unit Tests** → Component-level validation
4. **Integration Tests** → Service integration validation
5. **Security Scan** → Vulnerability detection
6. **Build & Package** → Application packaging
7. **E2E Tests** → User journey validation
8. **Performance Tests** → Load and performance validation
9. **Deploy to Staging** → Staging environment deployment
10. **Smoke Tests** → Basic functionality validation
11. **Deploy to Production** → Production deployment (manual approval)
